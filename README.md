# PyChallenge

Learned new trick on using PyCharm effectively

- for multiline cursor on mac use `shift + option + 8` to activate and then to move selection up and down use `shift + up arrow` or `shift + down arrow`.
- this can also be done with mouse click `option + click` on each multiline cursor.
