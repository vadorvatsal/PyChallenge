# This document contains how to work with regular expressions and few of examples to try
# You need to use some regular expression engine to work with
# Here we are using python engine and read the documentation if you need to know how to start with it

# There are different flags which indicates modes of our regular expression
# Possible modes are,
#
# Standard          :   /re/
# Global            :   /re/g
# Case insensitive  :   /re/i
# Multi line        :   /re/m

# Keep in mind that searches are case-sensitive by default
# famous UNIX based regex program is called grep which stands for g/re/p - global regular expression print
